# BraTs-tryout
Practicing with different deep learning models on 3D brain tumor segmentation data.

Using BraTs 2023 data to practice training 3D semantic segmentation models. Example MRI-slice from the (multi-class) dataset:

Models to try:
- Simple 3D-CNN
- U-net
- YOLOv8 (pre-trained & fine-tuning)
- ...
